I have been self-employed for more than 25 years, with a past in interviewing, writing articles, and columns for lifestyle magazines. I then started to work for television programs as a web editor as my assignments gradually shifted from offline, to online commissions (Keuringsdienst van Waarde, Klootwijk aan Zee, Tony Chocolonely). Around that time I discovered that being creative, really is where my talent lies. ‘Concept & Content’ creation is what I adore and have mainly been doing for the last couple of years. I love collaborating with other creatives and producing online campaigns.
