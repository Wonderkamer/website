# Wunderkammer Amsterdam Website

Website for [Wunderkammer Amsterdam](https://wunderkammer-amsterdam.github.io).

Deployment is done automaticly via github actions configured on this [Wunderkammer-Amsterdam/website](https://github.com/Wunderkammer-Amsterdam/website) repository. (Meaning changes should be done on that repository).

Note that deployments to github.io only support static files. It does *not* support dynamic server functionality such as .htaccess. Therefore this deployment is only partially functional.
